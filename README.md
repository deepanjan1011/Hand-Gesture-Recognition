#Hand Sign Recognition Using Machine Learning
This project demonstrates a hand recognition system built with TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Machine Learning techniques. It allows users to interact using hand signs, collect custom data, and recognize alphabets via gestures.

#Features
1. Real-time Hand Sign Recognition: Detects and interprets hand signs.
2. Custom Data Collection: Collect hand gesture data for training.
3. Alphabet Display: Recognizes hand signs and displays corresponding alphabets.
   
#Project Structure
1. app.py: Main application for recognizing hand signs.
2. datacollection.py: Script to collect custom hand gesture data from users.
3. test.py: Tests and displays alphabets based on recognized hand gestures.
   
#Requirements
Make sure to install the required dependencies before running the scripts.

bash:
pip install -r requirements.txt

#Usage
1. Data Collection
Run the datacollection.py script to collect data for training the model:

bash:
python datacollection.py

2. Hand Sign Recognition
Use the app.py script to recognize hand signs in real time:

bash:
python app.py

3. Testing Hand Signs
Test the system's ability to display alphabets using test.py:

bash:
python test.py
